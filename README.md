# Python Bind Shell Listener

This repository contains a simple Python-based bind shell designed for **educational use only**. It listens on a specified TCP port and allows remote users to connect and obtain an interactive shell on the host system via a specified port. 

To run the script, execute the following command:

`python3 bind_shell.py`

Once the script is running, a remote user can connect using:

`nc <target_ip> 18252`

Ensure that port `18252` is open on the target system and that any firewalls are properly configured to allow incoming connections.

This script listens on TCP port `18252` and spawns a Bash shell for any client that connects, using a pseudo-terminal for full interactivity. It also disables bash history by setting `HISTFILE` to `/dev/null`, making it harder to detect in logs. 

Key Features:
- Binds to a local port and waits for incoming connections.
- Provides an interactive Bash shell using `pty.spawn()`.
- Disables bash history for stealth by setting `HISTFILE` to `/dev/null`.
- Forks child processes to handle multiple incoming connections.
- Written in Python 3.
